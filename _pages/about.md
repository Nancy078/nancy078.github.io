I am a first year PhD student at University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI) studying NLP and computational social science, advised by David Jurgens and Justine Zhang. I am particularly interested in studying conversation analysis and social media.

I graduated with BA in Statistics and Data Science from UC Berkeley in 2023.
