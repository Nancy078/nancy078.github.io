I am an incoming PhD student at University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI) studying NLP and computational social science. I am advised by David Jurgens and Justine Zhang. I am particularly interested in studying social media and conversations.

I graduated with BA in Statistics and Data Science from UC Berkeley in 2023.
