Hi! I am a second year PhD student at University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI) studying NLP and computational social science, advised by David Jurgens and Justine Zhang. I am a part of the [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/). I am particularly interested in studying conversations in institutional settings, such as doctor-patient conversations.

I graduated with BA in Statistics and Data Science from UC Berkeley in 2023.
